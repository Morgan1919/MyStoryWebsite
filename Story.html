    <h1>The Afganistan Mission</h1>
    <h2>By: Morgan Feller</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time Morgan was shipped to Afganistan on a secret mission. So secret he couldn't say why he was going. He was going to disinfect the worlds most expensive Otterbox. This Otterbox was the holiest thing on the planet and had to be preserved by Morgan. Morgan attempted to disinfect the Otterbox for multiple days, but could not figure it out. Eventually Morgan thought: screw it! I'm going to buy the same Otterbox and everything is going to be fine. Morgan flew back to America to get an identical Otterbox and then flew back to Afganistan with the fake Otterbox. Head scientists and officials inspected the phone and had told Morgan he had done a great job with perserving the Otterbox. Because of Morgans heroic "disinfection" he won the Noble Peace Prize later in the year.</p>
